# Module 9: Inheritance

Inheritance is a common and useful practice when you're trying to reuse code. It allows you to use the code defined in a class in a similar other one. To inherit from a class you must create a second class and use the `extends` keyword.

### `Dog.java`
```java
class Dog{
        // variables
        boolean wild = true;
        
        // constructors
        
        // methods
        public void piss(){}
        
        // internal classes
        
}
```

<br>

### `Husky.java`
```java
class Husky extends Dog{
// Includes everything defined in Dog

}
```
<br>

`Husky`'s constructor should call `Dog`'s constructor. This is done by using `super()`

```java
...
public Husky() {
        // Replace dots with actual arguments. 
        super(...);
		
}
...
```

<br>

### Overriding
On occasions you will want to make modifications to a method that has already been defined in the super class. When attempting to do, you will notice an error. This is because the compiler does not know which version to use. For this reason we will use an `@Override` tag above the method we want to use as a replacement.

<br>

```java
class Husky extends Dog{

        @Override
        public void piss(){} 
}
```
